**Explanation of Changes:**

Based on the user requests and existing code structure, Dockerfiles have been added for both the backend and the frontend.

*   **`nft-purchase-app/backend/Dockerfile`**:
    *   `FROM python:3.9-slim-buster`:  Uses a slimmed-down version of the Python 3.9 image as the base image to reduce the final image size.
    *   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   `COPY requirements.txt .`: Copies the `requirements.txt` file to the working directory.
    *   `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Installs the Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`. The `--no-cache-dir` option is used to prevent `pip` from caching packages, which can further reduce the image size.
    *   `COPY . .`: Copies the entire backend directory to the working directory.
    *   `ENV FLASK_APP=app.py`: Sets an environment variable to tell Flask where application lives at.
    *   `CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]`: Defines the command to start the Flask application. `--host=0.0.0.0` makes the server accessible from outside the container .

*   **`nft-purchase-app/frontend/Dockerfile`**:
    *   `FROM node:16-alpine`: Uses the Alpine Linux-based Node.js 16 image as the base image for a smaller image size.
    *   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   `COPY package*.json .`: Copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the working directory.
    *   `RUN npm install`: Installs the Node.js dependencies defined in `package.json`.
    *   `COPY . .`: Copies the entire frontend directory to the working directory.
    *   `CMD ["npm", "start"]`: Defines the command to start the React application using `npm start`. This assumes that your `package.json` file has a `start` script defined, which is standard for React projects created with `create-react-app`.

These Dockerfiles provide a straightforward way to containerize the backend and frontend applications, making deployment and scaling easier.
